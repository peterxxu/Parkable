Major features:
	1. Homepage: an interactive Google Maps with markers indicating parking lot locations, also a sidebar containing parking lot information cards
	2. Star rating and comment: For each parking lot, the user can leave a rating by clicking on star icons and also leave an optional comment for the parking lot. User rating and comments are stored in local db.json
